# Pokemon-Candy-Hunt
I created an interactive game using Scratch. In the game, after being introduced to the world of pokemon by Porfessor Oak, the user selects a starter pokemon, either Bulbasaur, Squirtle, or Charmander. Afterwards, there is an instructions slide and the user must click their mouse to begin the game. Once the game begins, the user must use the arrow keys on their keyboard to move their pokemon around and collect all ten pieces of rare candy on the screen without being touched by the members of Team Rocket who are chasing them, if not they lose.
